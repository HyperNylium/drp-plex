### Release Notes

- Adds support for pausing presence updates when media is paused via the `display.paused` config property. When enabled, presence will show the last known activity with a "Paused" status when media is paused. The `display.pause_timeout` config property can be used to set a timeout (in seconds) after which the presence will clear if the media remains paused. A value of `0` means the presence will remain indefinitely while paused.
